# First attempt with an API
This is a very simple page that uses <a href="https://restcountries.com/">REST Countries API</a>. Built with React.

## How is it all displayed?
After fetching and sorting the data alphabetically, the countries and their infos are displayed on cards created with a simple `.map((value) => <Card props/>)`. The props, in this case, are the data that you can see on the project.

## Why is it so ugly?
